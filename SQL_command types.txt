1---Data definition language (DDL) commands enable you to perform the following tasks.  

Implicit commit

Create, alter, and drop schema objects
Grant and revoke privileges and roles
Add comments to the data dictionary
The CREATE, ALTER, and DROP commands require exclusive access to the object being acted upon. 
For example, an ALTER TABLE command fails if another user has an open transaction on the specified table.

ALTER SEQUENCE
CREATE PROCEDURE
DROP INDEX
ALTER SESSION
CREATE SCHEMA
DROP JAVA
ALTER TABLE
CREATE SEQUENCE
DROP PROCEDURE
ALTER TRIGGER
CREATE SYNONYM
DROP SCHEMA
ALTER USER
GRANT
DROP SEQUENCE
ALTER VIEW
REVOKE
DROP SYNONYM
CREATE DATABASE
CREATE TABLE
DROP TABLE
CREATE FUNCTION
CREATE TRIGGER
DROP TRIGGER
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE
CREATE USER
DROP USER
CREATE INDEX
CREATE VIEW
DROP VIEW
CREATE JAVA
DROP FUNCTION
TRUNCATE TABLE




2---Data manipulation language (DML) commands query and manipulate data in existing schema objects. 

These commands do not implicitly commit the current transaction.

DELETE
SELECT
EXPLAIN PLAN
subquery::=
INSERT
UPDATE


3---Transaction control commands manage changes made by DML commands.

COMMIT
SAVEPOINT
ROLLBACK
SET TRANSACTION

4---Clauses are subsets of commands that modify the command.

CONSTRAINT clause
DROP clause
